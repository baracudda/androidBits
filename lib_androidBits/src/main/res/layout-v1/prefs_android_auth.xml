<!-- PreferenceScreens do not have to have the layout_height nor layout_width attributes
     that the IDE is trying to shove down our throats.  Its only because these XML files
     exists here in the Layouts folder tree that the IDE complains about it. The reason they
     exist here instead of inside the generic xml folder is that we take advantage of the
     layout selectors (v1, v14, etc) to switch out what widgets the Settings activity uses
     based on what is available.  Switch-style controls are only available v14+ so checkbox
     settings can have a v14 layout what uses switches instead of checkboxes.  And so on.
     Also, in order to list the R ID into a Values->Arrays.xml list, there is no R.xml.*
     so it must be located in someplace like the layout folder in order to get a "standard R"
     id value that can be referenced elsewhere as "@layout/blah".

     Now, having said all that, adding layout_height and layout_width will not hurt anything
     so let us just add it so the IDE will stfu about it.
